This API helps create a course program for your school/university through a simple HTML interface that can be accessed at http://localhost:8000/ . The courses are saved in your computer so you can edit the current program whenever you want.

You can either run this program through the terminal if you wish to close it or use the .exe file if you do not mind the API staying up.
